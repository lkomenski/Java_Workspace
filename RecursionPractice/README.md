# Recursion Practice

This project demonstrates basic recursion in Java.

The program includes recursive methods for:
- Calculating a factorial
- Summing the values in an array
- Computing Fibonacci numbers

A `main` method is included to test each recursive method and print results to the console.

## How to Run
```bash
javac RecursionPractice.java
java RecursionPractice
